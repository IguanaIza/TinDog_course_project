TinDog idea comes from udemy course  - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

It's my first work using Bootstrap. It's useful, but I abandoned it for a while to learn more about CSS (and later JS) so I could create all this stuff by myself.

It's actually not my work if I did everything step by step with the course, but hey - I learned some useful things, didn't I? :)
